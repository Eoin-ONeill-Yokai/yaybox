# YayBox for Distrobox
This is a docker environment intended to be used in conjunction with distrobox to quickly create an easy-to-use container for all things AUR. 

## TODO
- Create a more detailed readme
- Create and expose more utility scripts
- Test more use cases and fix programs that work incorrectly.
